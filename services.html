					<h3 class="subheading">Acupuncture</h3>
					
						<p>Chinese medicine has long held that the human body is a whole system, each part is connected to every other. Acupuncture maps out these connections with meridians that wind their way through this system. With gentle insertion of small, hair-thin needles into "acupoints" that lie on these meridians, we can affect not only superficial areas of the body, but also deep ones. I seek to encourage the body's own natural mechanisms to balance itself and promote healing.</p>
						
						<p>Your acupuncture treatment will be tailored to fit your individual needs and preferences. I will also finish your treatment with cupping, oil massage or shiatsu at no extra cost.</p>
						
						<p>$80 per each acupuncture treatment without insurance.</p>
						
						<p>Copays and other costs vary for acupuncture with insurance.</p>
				

					<h3 class="subheading">Shiatsu</h3>
					
						<p>Shiatsu massage is available separately at $100 per each treatment.
						<p>Shiatsu or "finger pressure" massage, is a Japanese style of massage that uses the same meridians as Chinese acupuncture. Shiatsu releases tension, extinguishes pain and improves flexibility.</p>
						
						<p>In contrast to other types of massage, clothes remain on during the treatment.</p>
						
						<p>$100 per each shiatus treatment, cash only.</p>

					<h3 class="subheading">Reiki and Others</h3>
					
						<p>Reiki is a gentle Japanese healing technique. Hands are placed on the body or near the body to gently harmonize a person's energy. I often use this technique in conjunction with acupuncture and shiatsu.</p>
						
						<p class="info">Cupping is a Chinese method that involves placing glass or plastic cups on the body. A suction is created under the cups to help release muscle tension and adhesions.</p>
						
						<p>Moxibustion is a Chinese technique using the herb, mugwort. This herb is burned near the body for a variety of benefits including relief from pain and stiffness in joints, and to encourage healthy digestion.</p>
						
						<p>Chinese Herbal Medicine is a powerful tool in treating illness, both externally and internally. </p>
						
						<p>Meditation can help relieve anxiety, depression and physical illness. The state of the mind is very important to the state of the body. I practice a Chinese form of meditation called Qigong, and can teach you some simple but effective exercises.</p>
